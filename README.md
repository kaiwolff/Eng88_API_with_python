#APIs

Stands for Application Programming Interface.

**An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and interact with external software components, operating systems, or microservices. To simplify, an API delivers a user response to a system and sends the system's response back to a user.**

Need to have:


 - network connectivity
 - App used must be accessible at both ends

There are status codes, which are sometimes seen in for example websites (e.g. the infamous 404 error).

API Calls are behind almost any tracking in apps, e.g. live delivery tracking. Almost any automated messages require API calls.
